With over 10 years of experience in technical communication, I can create user-centered content for help systems, interfaces, and marketing collateral. I have always advocated for clear, consistent writing that facilitates understanding of complex concepts, task completion, and audience engagement. My body of work includes documentation, UX copy, marketing copy, style guides, terminology lists, and process documents.

# What I Do #

Specialization | Summary | Description
Content Strategy | Designing conversations between products and users | I establish content types, structures, and formats, and use technology to efficiently develop, manage, and deliver content.
Documentation writing | Building help systems that enable users to complete tasks | I specialize in structured authoring, which is a standardized, methodological approach to content creation.
UX writing | Creating user-centered content for web and mobile applications | I write interface text (also known as “microcopy”) that addresses what users feel and need at each step of their user journey.
